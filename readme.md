## Candy
These are what you use to battle and heal yourself and others. Everyone has a set amount of health.

- Unhealthy = When used on a target, decreases health by amount X candy level
  - REESES = 5
  - TWIX = 4
  - HERSHEY BAR = 4
  - KITKAT = 3
  - CRUNCH = 2
- Healthy = When used on a target, increases health by amount X candy level
  - LIFESAVERS = -5
  - WERTHERS = -4
  - APPLE = -4
  - HEATH = -3
  - FRUIT GUMMIES = -2
- Special = When used on a target, applies effect X candy level
  - ROCK = 5 Damage and daze someone for a turn
  - NOW AND LATER = 4 Damage and attack again next turn
  - SWEDISH FISH = 3 Damage to two enemies
  - GUMMY BEARS = Takes damage for you next turn
  - NERDS ROPE = Tie up someone for next turn

### Candy Level Multiplier
These are multiplied by the base value of the candy. If there aren't enough random targets, it will trigger again on the same target.

  1. Fun Size = 0
  2. Regular Size = 2
  3. King Size = 3 and hits another random target
  4. Party Size = 3 and hits 2 additional random targets


## Trick
### Encounter
You'll fight either some kids or some pets or a combination in turn-based combat. Your basket is randomized at the start of battle. Each turn 4 pieces of candy are dealt out like a hand in a deck of cards. You have three energy and it takes 1 energy to use a candy.

#### Objective
Defeat the opposing targets by hurling candy at them to lower their health.

**Unhealthy candy** will lower target's health
**Healthy candy** will raise target's health
**Special candy** will perform an affect on the target

You can use any candy on your enemies or yourself, but ideally you'd use unhealthy candy on your enemies and healthy candy on yourself. Some special candies, like Rock, you'll want to use on enemies and other special candies, like Gummy Bears, you'll want to use on yourself.

#### Enemy actions
- Use unhealthy candy on player
- Use healthy candy on itself
- Use special candy on player or itself (if it's beneficial)
- Dazed (can't attack)
- Tied up (can't attack)

#### Your turn
At the start of your turn your enemy will pick it's next attack and show it's intent above it's head.
   1. Draw candy out of your basket like cards of a deck
   2. Use a candy on a target (costs 1 energy)
   3. Once you're out of energy, or kill last enemy, or choose to, your turn will end and the enemy's turn will begin

### Collect Candy
If you successfully complete the encounter, you'll be granted the opportunity to pick a piece of candy from three candies. The chances for each candy are below:

#### Candy chance
- Regular House
  - Fun size - 60%
  - Regular size - 25%
  - King size - 10%
  - Party size - 5%
- Rich House
  - Fun size - 10%
  - Regular size - 40%
  - King size - 40%
  - Party size - 10%

#### Candy upgrade
You can upgrade candy if you have 2 of a kind with Party size being the max
